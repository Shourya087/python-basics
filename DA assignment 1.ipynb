What is Python, and why is it popular\n","---Python is a programming language which is used in data analysis, machine learning etc\n","it is so popular because:\n","it is easy to learn\n","it is an open source language\n","it has a large number of libraries\n","\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python\n","---it is someone who reads and execute python code\n","\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n","---pre defined keywords are those words in python whose function or meaning is already described in the programming language for example print(), and, true, int etc\n","\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n","---no keywords cannot be used as variable names as they have a predefined function in python code\n","\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python\n","---mutability is the characteristic of certain data types in python thta can be edited meaning items in them can be altered through indexing or various methods for example lists are mutable type of data structure\n","\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n","---lists are mutablr because the contents of lists can be modified, altered, deleted, added etc in the same list which is pre defined but for tuples these things cannot be applied thus they are immutable, to assign something new in a tuple we need to define a new tuple\n","\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n","---== is used to equate 2 entities in a python code and is a equality operator and 'is' is a pre defined keyword in python code which is a identity operator\n","\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python\n","--- logical operators are 'and', 'or', 'not' which assist in many conditional runnings of code\n","\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python\n","---typecasting is the mechanism where the type of a string, intergar, float can be converted into one other\n","\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n","---implicit type casting is something which python code assumes itself like if we enter 2 amd ask its type python code automatically understands it as an integer. explicit typecasting is something done by the coder or user according to his/her requirement\n","\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n","---purpose of conditional statemetns if, elif, else statements is to run a code with multiple conditions where multiple things are to be processed to give a fruitful result\n","\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work\n","---elif(else + if) statement is a conditional statement which is used when there are multiple conditions to be used in a python code\n","\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n","---while loop is loop which continues to work until situation given becomes false it can fill up the whole memory if false condition isnt provided and for loop is a loop to iterate through various data types which means it seperates through various data enteries done in a variable\n","\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n","---while loop can be more functional in scenarios where the number of runs are not known and iterations are not that much
